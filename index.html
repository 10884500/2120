            We love the Northwest because of its natural diversity, inspiring
            people, endless adventure, and countless opportunity. <br />

            Where else in the world can you find giant waterfalls, long
            stretches of fields, ocean waves, and multiple mountain ranges? (Not
            to mention volcanoes too!) The longer we visit here, the more we
            discover we will never run out of places to explore. <br />
            - Terry Porter

          We want everyone to experience the lands we get to live on everyday,
          so come see Beacon Rock, Haystack Rock, and our many other larger
          rocks in the Cascadia Mountain Range. Not to mention our waterfalls,
          coastline and islands all over!
